# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. Players take turns placing their shapes (X or O) on a 3x3 board. The first player to get three of their shapes in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the board fills up without a winner, it's a tie.

## Features

- Two-player game
- Randomly selects the starting player for the first game
- The winner of the game starts the next game
- Keeps track of players' scores
- Detects and announces the winner or if the game is a tie

2. The game board will be displayed, and players will take turns to enter their moves.
3. Players enter their move by specifying the row and column numbers (1, 2, or 3).
4. The game will check for a winner or a tie after each move.
5. The winner of the game starts the next game. If the game ends in a tie, the same player starts the next game.
6. The game will continue until the players decide to stop.
